With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks like React and Next js, I bring design concepts to life by transforming them into responsive, interactive websites. As a graphic designer, I focus on creating compelling visual elements, including logos, layouts, and UI components, ensuring that every design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also intuitive and user-centered. My ability to seamlessly integrate design and development allows me to deliver cohesive, engaging digital experiences that are both beautiful and user-friendly.</p>
